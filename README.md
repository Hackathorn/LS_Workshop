# LS_Workshop

 The overall system is called **Exploratory Semi-Supervised Machine Learning** (ESS-ML). It is composed of following pipeline to analyze datasets in terms of its latent (or hidden) space, thus revealing relationships useful to understanding and utilizing the data.

This repository contains the code for Exploring LS Patterns (Step 6), which takes data from the LS Data Server and preparing it for analysis in the next step - Applying LS Insights to a specific business problem by domain experts. It consists mainly of a Unity3D project that uses the Oculus Quest device to explore high-dimensional spaces for these latent spaces.

## Input Data

The input data consists several datasets that specify: (a) overall plot of the latent space, (b) points for data samples, and (c) clusters of points according to various criteria.
